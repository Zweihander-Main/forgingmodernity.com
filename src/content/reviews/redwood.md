This timely book reminds us what a great achievement the Industrial revolution in Britain was in the period 1660-1830, taking living standards far higher than on the continent for the many and witnessing a flowering of new products and technologies. Furthermore, it gave ideas to the world to raise their wages and wealth as they caught up in the nineteenth century. Hutchinson explains why this happened first in Britain, and how Tory politics helped by allowing local and entrepreneurial diversity and experimentation without heavy handed taxation and regulation. It is refreshing to be told that there is a lot good about economic growth, freeing people from poverty and extending opportunities for many to earn and save more and enjoy a better lifestyle.
