The Birmingham Canal was authorized by Parliament in February 1768, with sponsorship from Matthew Boulton and the Lunar Society, to run from Birmingham to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal near Wolverhampton, on a Brindley plan which was largely level but meandering, with branches to Ocker Hill and Wednesbury, where there were coal mines. Five hundred shares of £140 were subscribed for a total of £70,000, with 23% of the shares bought by manufacturers. The cost overrun to an eventual cost of £112,400, or £4,091 per mile, was covered by short-term loans and subventions from running profits. The first stretch was to Wednesbury, whereupon the price of household coal in Birmingham halved overnight; the full canal of nearly 23 miles with 30 locks was completed in 1772, just before Brindley’s death. There were two separate terminals in Birmingham, as well as a branch to Boulton’s Soho Manufactory; the canal enabled Birmingham’s metalworking industries to serve export markets directly. Smethwick Hill turned out to be too soft for tunnelling, so locks were built; it also proved difficult to ensure adequate water feed to Smethwick Hill, so two Watt engines were installed in 1778 and 1779 to ensure full-time operation.
The Birmingham Canal borrowed another £121,400 from 1784 to 1798 to construct the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, providing a more direct link to the Coventry Canal; this money was repaid between 1800 and 1819. With this additional leverage and new asset, the canal’s £140 shares were already selling at £900 in 1792 and were divided into eighths for greater convenience; by 1828 an eighth-share was selling for £300, while dividends were 100% on the original £140 shares.
