The Coventry Canal was authorized by a separate Act in 1768 with 500 shares of £100, half of which came from Coventry businessmen. Since the canal runs 38 miles north from Coventry to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Fradley Junction, the initial capital was clearly inadequate, being only £1,316 per mile of canal. Brindley was again hired to construct the canal but was fired within a year when the canal ran out of money – his construction standards were allegedly too high. Construction ceased in 1771, by which time the canal had reached Atherstone colliery. Further loan capital of £37,500 was not raised until 1786, and the canal was completed and connected to the Trent and Mersey in 1790. Still, the canal’s long-term profitability was good; by 1834 the £100 shares stood at £610 and paid a dividend of 44% during the 1820s.
