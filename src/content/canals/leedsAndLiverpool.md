The Leeds and Liverpool Canal was the most ambitious of all these early schemes and the longest canal in Britain, given parliamentary authorization in May 1770 on plans drawn up by the ubiquitous Brindley for a 109-mile canal with a 14-ft width, at a cost of £259,777. The parliamentary authorization specified capital of £260,000, plus another £60,000 callable if necessary. The initial issue was undersubscribed, but the sale of 1,919 shares of £100 was notable for a high 36% subscription by merchant ‘capitalists’. Almost half the initial shareholders came from Yorkshire’s Aire Valley, with other large investments from Liverpool.

The Yorkshire side of the canal reached from Leeds to Gargrave (four miles north-west of Skipton) by 1777; the Lancashire side was built from Liverpool to Wigan by 1781, when the money ran out with a total of 61½ miles built. Work resumed in 1790, proceeding along a more southerly route in Lancashire and financed by an issue of a further 697 shares of £100 par value at prices of £160 and £180, by borrowing £442,154 on mortgage by 1822 and by setting aside toll income.1 The 1,640-yard Foulridge Tunnel, costing £40,000 alone, was completed in 1796, opening the canal across the Pennines from Leeds to eastern Burnley. The canal was then lengthened in several stages, with the main canal opened in 1816 and final completion in 1820, at a cost of £1.2 million, or £9,449 per mile. The canal was quite successful financially despite its huge cost; by 1829, the £100 shares were selling at £470 and paying a dividend of 18%.2 With its access to coal mines, limestone kilns and factories, it was central to Lancashire’s textile industry once steam-powered factories became common.
