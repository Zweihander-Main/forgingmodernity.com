Plans had been drawn up for the Trent and Mersey Canal by James Brindley with Gower’s funding and encouragement before 1759, but nothing further was done because Gower did not want to finance it alone. Wedgwood became interested in 1761 and with Gower worked to secure broad-based local financing. When the canal was authorised in 1766, £66,900 of the authorized share capital of £130,000 had been subscribed. By further Acts of Parliament of 1770, 1775 and 1776, another £166,000 was borrowed, making a total debt and equity capital of £296,000.

Peers put up only 7% of the equity, but Samuel Egerton of Tatton Park, Cheshire, put up £42,750 of the loan capital and landed gentry, including Egerton, held 39% of the shares and 46% of the loan capital. In Staffordshire £140,000 of the share and loan capital was raised but only £19,300 in the Potteries. (The Wedgwood family, who contributed £6,000, were nothing like as rich in 1766 as they later became, but Josiah Wedgwood cut the first sod of soil at the massive celebration on 26 July 1766.) Samuel Egerton (1711-80) was a second cousin of Bridgewater and a Tory MP for Cheshire from 1754 until 1780, described by the ‘Public Ledger’ in 1779 as: ‘A very wealthy country gentlemen, and a Tory in principle. He votes constantly with Government when he attends Parliament and professes a great veneration for Lord North.’

The Trent and Mersey Canal was 93 miles long, from Preston Brook, where it meets the Bridgewater Canal, to the River Trent at Derwent Mouth in Derbyshire. It offered two huge advantages to pottery manufacturers like Wedgwood. First, it greatly reduced the cost of transporting Cornish china clays, which had recently been discovered near St Austell. Second, it enabled potters to avoid the large pottery breakages from road transport – the roads round Burslem were notorious because potters dug them up for the clay, an essential ingredient.

By 1771, when Wedgwood’s Etruria factory opened, most of the canal had been built to Preston Brook, as had the eastern section from Burslem to the Trent. At Kidsgrove Hill, near Stoke-on-Trent, the canal passed through the 2,880-yard Harecastle Tunnel, boatmen propelling their crafts by foot, lying on their backs. The canal’s economics were helped by the fact that Kidsgrove Hill proved to consist largely of coal, which was mined by the Golden Hill colliery, partly owned by Brindley. Moreover, since Kidsgrove stood at the canal’s high point, the steam engine pumping out the mine supplied the necessary water to the canal. Even with this tunnel, the canal’s cost was a relatively modest £3,213 per mile.

The canal was constructed by Brindley to follow the land’s contours; it therefore swings a long way south to meet the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and the later Coventry Canal, before swinging back north to meet the Trent. The full canal was opened in 1777; like the Staffordshire and Worcestershire, the Trent and Mersey Canal was immediately financially successful, paying off its bonded debt, and at the 1825 peak sold for £4,000 per £200 share, paying an annual dividend of £150. The canal was profitable until World War I.
