The Oxford Canal was the final link in Brindley’s Grand Cross scheme – it provided the link to the Thames. It was authorized by Parliament in 1769, sponsored by the company’s chairman, Sir Roger Newdigate, the Tory MP for Oxford University, a country gentleman with large landholdings in Warwickshire and Middlesex, who wrote after George III’s accession: ‘Men must love peace, men proscribed and abused for 50 years should be presented with fools’ caps if they make ladders for tyrant Whigs to mount by.’

The canal’s initial capital was £150,000 in £100 shares, but only £122,300 was taken up; a further attempted share issue of £30,000 in 1775 raised only £18,900; the gap was filled by loans of £70,000 in 1775-79 and £60,000 in 1786-90. The largest subscriptions came from Oxford and villages along the canal’s route, with clerical Oxford dons subscribing 13% of the shares and £35,000 of the loan capital.
The canal’s route runs 78 miles, from the Coventry Canal at Hawkesbury Lock to Oxford, where it connects with the Thames; its construction was supervised by Brindley until his death. The canal reached Banbury in 1778, where construction ceased for lack of funds. Construction from Banbury to Oxford continued in 1786 on the cheapest possible basis, incorporating part of the River Cherwell, and the canal was finally opened in Oxford on 1 January 1790. It was highly profitable for its first fifteen years, until the Grand Junction Canal’s main section was opened in 1805 – apparently, already in 1790 Newdigate was receiving as annual income the entire amount of his initial investment. The canal was still quite profitable in 1829, paying a 32% dividend with a share price of £670 per £100 share.
