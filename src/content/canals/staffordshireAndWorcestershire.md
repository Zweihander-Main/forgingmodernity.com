The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal appears to have been sponsored partly by Gower, the largest landowner in Staffordshire and the principal sponsor of the simultaneously approved Trent and Mersey. Its capital was £70,000 initially, with an additional £30,000 callable; apart from two peers, about a quarter of the shareholders were landed gentry and just over half were tradesmen, mostly from Wolverhampton and Kidderminster. The canal was 46 miles long, linking the River Severn at Stourport with the Trent and Mersey Canal at Haywood Junction. It had 43 locks, 31 taking it up 292 feet from the Severn to a ten-mile summit before the remaining twelve locks took it down to Haywood Junction. It followed natural contours, minimizing artifacts but making it longer than necessary – its cost per mile was £2,168, the lowest of the early canals. The canal was completed by 1771, albeit with a modest cost overrun, and opened to traffic in 1772, carrying coal from nearby mines to the iron works of John Wilkinson and Abraham Darby III and pottery from Staffordshire to Bristol’s international shipping trade. It was an immediate financial success, profitable into the twentieth century, by 1828 paying a dividend of £40 on each £100 share (for which £140 was paid up) and selling at £800 per share.
