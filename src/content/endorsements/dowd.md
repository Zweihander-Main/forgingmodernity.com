An entertaining, splendid and stunningly original history of one of the most important events of human history, Forging Modernity explores the origins of the Industrial Revolution when human living standards were pulled up from grinding Malthusian poverty and onto the path to modern levels of prosperity. Why did the industrial revolution occur first in Britain, and what was its main cause? Hutchinson’s answer is that it occurred thanks to Britain’s strong property rights and the relative lack of state interference in the economy. Its intellectual roots are to be found in the royalism of the post-Restoration period, which was to find its apogee in the high Toryism of the eighteenth century. And had it not been for the Whigs’ grubby meddling early in that century, the Industrial Revolution might have occurred half a century before it did. At long last, a Tory and not a Whig interpretation of history!
